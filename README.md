Cryptic is a simple React App that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using symmetric substitution ciphers.

## Ciphers
* **Caesar**: Shifts text by a given number of letters (between 1 and 25).
* **Monosubstitution**: Uses a key to map two sets of alphabets, and perform encryption/decryption.
* **Vigenere**: A polysubstitution cipher that leverages caesar ciphers to encrypt/decrypt letters according to a key.
